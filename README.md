# Algorithm

> **What is this repository?**


While I was learning Python by reading the book called Learn to Code by Solving problems by Daniel Zingaro, I realized It is quite fun to think deeply about the questions or problems. 

After that, I started learning algorithms that used widly in the programming through all the ways that I can find. 
<br> This repository tells what I have learned from algorithm study journey and keeps the idea that I want to spread to someone else.

> **The tips to read this repository**
1. I picked up the knowledge by solving exercies from programming judge website, mainly called Baekjoon (This website is developed at South Korea).
<br> I illustrates the question in detail in each algorithm file.
2. You can go to the judge website by clicking the name of problems and you can translate the exercises.
