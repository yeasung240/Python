#### statement

Jimin loves to go to parties and tell stories. Whenever he goes to a party, Jimin tells his favorite story. When Jimin tells his story, he either tells it as it is or exaggerates it greatly. Of course, it is much more fun to tell an exaggerated story, so he tries to exaggerate as much as possible. However, Jimin does not want to be known as a liar. The problem is that some people know the truth of the story. Therefore, when these people come to the party, Jimin has no choice but to tell the truth. Of course, when someone hears the truth at one party and the exaggerated story at another party, Jimin will be known as a liar. Jimin must avoid all of these things.

The number of people N is given. And the person who knows the truth of the story is given. And the number of people coming to each party is given. Jimin must attend all the parties. At this time, write a program to find the maximum number of parties in which Jimin can tell an exaggerated story without being known as a liar.

#### Input

The number of people N and the number of parties M are given in the first line.

The second line gives the number of people who know the truth of the story and their numbers. The number of people who know the truth is given first, and then the number of people is given. The numbers of people are given as numbers from 1 to N.

From the third line, in the M lines, the number of people coming to each party and their numbers are given in the same way.

N and M are natural numbers less than or equal to 50, the number of people who know the truth is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 50, and the number of people coming to each party is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 50.

#### Output
