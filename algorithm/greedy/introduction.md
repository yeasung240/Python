### Greedy algorithm 

Greedy algorithm is the process that the best choice in the condition now will bring the best solution in the end.

> The process of the greedy algorithm
1. First chose the best solution in the given condition
2. Check if the solution chosen is aligned with the condition of the problem
3. Check if the the group of solution can solve the entire problem, if it could not solve, go back to number 1.

>Priority queue and heapq in the greedy algorithm

To solve questions related to greedy algorithm, the priority queue and heapq is used frequently. 

* **Frequent used code in heapq**
  1. heapify : change lists to heapq
  2. heappop(heap) : extract the smallest value in numbers
  3. heappush(heap, value) : append the value to the heapq
